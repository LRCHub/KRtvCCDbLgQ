You smoked and you looked at me
I hate it when you do
I said, “No,thanks” to you
You asked me if I was okay,
What if I wasn’t?
Leaving is fine
It’s just I don’t wanna be
all by myself again
Like every time,
Like every last time
You knew that
I was no good for you
When we lay down after
doing that things you loved
You knew that
I wasn’t better than you
I hope that I could be seemed
Really fine with you leaving
You stroked me and stared at me
I like it when you do
I said "I know you love me too"
I asked you
"If you are the same,
what If I quit it"
Leaving is fine
It’s just I don’t wanna be
falling behind again
Like every time
Like every moment in the end
You knew that
I was no good for you
When we lay down After
doing that things you loved
You knew that
I wasn’t better than you
I hope that I could be seemed
Really fine with you leaving
Suddenly all the things
seem complicated
You could only fix it
But my lips won’t
let me tell the truth
Tell me how not to get
hurted or broken
Even If you can’t afford
loving me anymore
You knew that
I was no good for you
When we lay down After
doing that things you loved
You knew that
I wasn’t better than you
I hope that I could be seemed
Really fine with you leaving
You smoked and you looked at me
I hate it when you do
